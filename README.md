# Interactive Data Processing Program

This is the bash script that I wrote for one of my assignments for a computational tools course in the Clinical Bioinformatics program I am completeing. It allows users to download FASTA and FASTQ files using Entrez Direct and SRA-tools commands, and then provides options for basic data processing using bioawk. With the use of several while loops, users can download as many files and perform as many data processing steps as they would like. Users also have the option to either display their results directly on screen or to save their data to individual files.
