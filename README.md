# Resume Projects
Welcome! This repository contains projects specifically mentioned in my resume. You can find more information on each project in this README file, including a summary of the project's purpose/features and references to the associated code. Feel free to check out some of my other repositories for more school and personal projects.

## Interactive Data Processing Program
Code: dataproce.sh
This is the bash script that I wrote for one of my assignments for a computational tools course in the Clinical Bioinformatics program I am completeing. It allows users to download FASTA and FASTQ files using Entrez Direct and SRA-tools commands, and then provides options for basic data processing using bioawk. With the use of several while loops, users can download as many files and perform as many data processing steps as they would like. Users also have the option to either display their results directly on screen or to save their data to individual files. 

## Data Analysis and Visualization Recreation
Code: data_analysis.R
This is the R script that I wrote (in collaboration with 3 other classmates) for the final project of a data mining and modeling course in the Clinical Bioinformatics program I am completeing. It takes data from a published paper and recreates the analyses based on another script found here on GitHub. The reference code used only base R, and this project uses various R packages such as tidyverse, ggplot2, DESeq2, and EnhancedVolcano to perform the same analyses. These results, as well as the results from the reference code and the original paper, all align.
